## About
You've just been hired by a bus company that started actively using the Internet for business. Before you came, their database had been updated a few times by various employees with various levels of skill. Your task is to find all the mistakes they made in the database. Good news: you have documentation, but bad news: it's incomplete. This promises to be quite an investigation!
## Learning outcomes
In addition to writing your own programs to test data consistency and correctness, you will practice reading documentation, working with data in JSON format, and creating lists and dictionaries. You will also learn how to work with set methods and regular expression library.
